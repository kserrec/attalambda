# Session handoff

Kyle explicitly authorized publishing AttaLambda 0.6.0 on 2026-09-08. Execute
both phases of the release plan at the top of [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) autonomously;
no additional publication confirmation is required. The plan authorizes the
verified Linux x86-64 archive and SHA256SUMS, annotated v0.6.0 tag, GitHub
Release publication, fresh public-download checks, and final documentation.

Starting main: `0f85683d3b8747078b532d88bc0ccecfb7ac610b`. The printing milestone
is complete and PR #4 is merged. All ten checks passed in
[CI run 34188023243](https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/actions/runs/34188023243),
including 45 files, 17,064 assertions, 39 pure modules, and complete boundaries.
The current work adds only the 0.6.0 / 0.6 version state, release documentation,
and a packaged Linux printing check; pure computation and host authority remain
unchanged. Release notes are [docs/releases/0.6.0.md](docs/releases/0.6.0.md).

Phase 1 release inputs are verified: focused checks passed 581 assertions,
and `env TMPDIR=/tmp ./run-all-tests.sh` passed all 45 files and 17,065
assertions, 39 pure modules, and complete boundaries in one run. Logs are
`/tmp/attalambda-060-focused.log` and `/tmp/attalambda-060-full-suite.log`.
The preparation commit is the input for Phase 2. Build that clean commit with
the cached Racket CS 9.3 image, run the isolated Linux consumer, and wait for
all preparation CI jobs before tagging/staging/publishing. Verify draft and
fresh public bytes against the exact local assets, then record publication.
GitHub's latest release was still 0.5.0 at orientation; README download links
remain there until 0.6.0 is published. Preserve older releases, tags, and assets.

## Completed 0.5.0 release (historical)

Status recorded 2026-09-07: the recursive-purity milestone and 0.5.0 release
are complete on main. Kyle authorized continuing through the described
merge/build/verify/publish steps. No release work or confirmed review finding
remains pending; future work requires a new request.

PR https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/pull/3 merged as
`d770b8335a06a8ec6e5925030c4a92cde88e85d8`. Its tree equals reviewed head
`39fa142800c7bfc33e407fb93718960f91fe90d9`. All ten PR CI jobs and all ten
post-merge jobs passed. The local and merged CI source gates each passed
41 suites, 14,210 assertions, 32-module expanded purity, and complete
boundaries/source inventory. The automated review's one suggestion did not
match observed module-wide binding behavior; source and packaged-runtime
probes disproved it, the PR records the assessment, and its thread is resolved.

Published release: https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/releases/tag/v0.5.0,
at `2026-09-07T20:21:07Z`. Unsigned annotated tag `v0.5.0` points to the exact
clean merged commit used for the Racket CS 9.3 Linux archive. The final archive
passed the isolated Ubuntu consumer, including 31 public-API checks with
`rec` execution and partial application, guide, file/TCP/HTTP, process statuses,
and relocation. Fresh public downloads matched both verified local hashes.
Archive SHA-256:
`9d87027d3fcad80c58668ce2d1d31365bba507131bc67889118e3d2ae7af36c4`.
Linux x86-64 remains the sole supported binary download; older releases remain
preserved. macOS and Windows provide internal portability evidence only.

[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) records the completed work and local evidence paths.
[docs/releases/0.5.0.md](docs/releases/0.5.0.md) explains `rec` and migration
from recursive `def`; [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) describes the released API.
The [release ledger](docs/design/standalone-distribution.md) records exact
commits, tag/asset IDs, sizes, hashes, and consumer results. The publication
record changes documentation only, outside the tagged build inputs.

## Completed 0.4.0 release (historical)

Status recorded 2026-09-06: the public API/List update, PR review, merge, and
0.4.0 release are complete. Kyle explicitly authorized each of those actions.
The checkout is on main. Subsequent release/feature work requires a new request;
the completed plans are historical evidence, not instructions to repeat work.
