# Session handoff

Milestone 6 generic pure printing is complete and merged into main.
All seven authorized implementation phases are complete; [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)
records the work and evidence. [PR #4](https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/pull/4)
merged with Kyle's explicit approval at `2026-09-08T03:33:50Z` as
`e088e1fc22463c1118127badcdc066c4f8b6cef6`. Its tree exactly equals approved
head `c3d61fd7a3baf75ba1e44f9fb27457ef67bc1ca6`.
Local Racket CS 8.10 and CI Racket CS 9.3 each passed
45 files, 17,064 assertions, 39 pure modules, and the boundary inventory.
The API example passed in an isolated installation; 185 local documentation
links and all five specification hashes were verified. Historical canonical
specification text remains byte-for-byte preserved before the new amendments.
All ten jobs in [CI run 34182567747](https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/actions/runs/34182567747)
passed for final PR head `c3d61fd`, including Linux,
both macOS architectures, Windows, and artifact cleanup. No review findings
were posted at merge. Local main is synced; the follow-up commit only records
the merge and updates source-status wording. Main's workflow shows post-merge
verification. No implementation or merge work remains. Release publication
requires a separate instruction; published 0.5.0 remains the latest release,
and no version, tag, or download metadata has changed.

## Completed 0.5.0 release (historical)

Status recorded 2026-09-07: the recursive-purity milestone and 0.5.0 release
are complete on main. Kyle authorized continuing through the described
merge/build/verify/publish steps. No release work or confirmed review finding
remains pending; future work requires a new request.

PR https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/pull/3 merged as
`d770b8335a06a8ec6e5925030c4a92cde88e85d8`. Its tree equals reviewed head
`39fa142800c7bfc33e407fb93718960f91fe90d9`. All ten PR CI jobs and all ten
post-merge jobs passed. The local and merged CI source gates each passed
41 suites, 14,210 assertions, 32-module expanded purity, and complete
boundaries/source inventory. The automated review's one suggestion did not
match observed module-wide binding behavior; source and packaged-runtime
probes disproved it, the PR records the assessment, and its thread is resolved.

Published release: https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/releases/tag/v0.5.0,
at `2026-09-07T20:21:07Z`. Unsigned annotated tag `v0.5.0` points to the exact
clean merged commit used for the Racket CS 9.3 Linux archive. The final archive
passed the isolated Ubuntu consumer, including 31 public-API checks with
`rec` execution and partial application, guide, file/TCP/HTTP, process statuses,
and relocation. Fresh public downloads matched both verified local hashes.
Archive SHA-256:
`9d87027d3fcad80c58668ce2d1d31365bba507131bc67889118e3d2ae7af36c4`.
Linux x86-64 remains the sole supported binary download; older releases remain
preserved. macOS and Windows provide internal portability evidence only.

[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) records the completed work and local evidence paths.
[docs/releases/0.5.0.md](docs/releases/0.5.0.md) explains `rec` and migration
from recursive `def`; [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) describes the released API.
The [release ledger](docs/design/standalone-distribution.md) records exact
commits, tag/asset IDs, sizes, hashes, and consumer results. The publication
record changes documentation only, outside the tagged build inputs.

## Completed 0.4.0 release (historical)

Status recorded 2026-09-06: the public API/List update, PR review, merge, and
0.4.0 release are complete. Kyle explicitly authorized each of those actions.
The checkout is on main. Subsequent release/feature work requires a new request;
the completed plans are historical evidence, not instructions to repeat work.
