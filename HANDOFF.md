# Session handoff

Current work: Milestone 6 generic pure printing on
`milestone-6-pure-printing`, authorized on 2026-09-07 for autonomous completion.
Phases 1–6 are committed and pushed; Phase 6 is `eb9a6d7`. All requested
production behavior is implemented, and its latest complete gate passed
45 files, 17,064 assertions, 39 pure modules, and the boundary inventory.
Phase 7's API/specification/architecture/acceptance documentation is verified,
including the executable API example, 185 local links, and all five contract
hashes. Its final complete source gate passed the same 45 files and 17,064
assertions in one run. PR creation and CI inspection remain; continue Step 7.2
in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).
No merge or release is authorized by this milestone plan; AGENTS.md requires
explicit approval to merge a language milestone. Published 0.5.0 remains the
latest release, and no version, tag, or download metadata has changed.

## Completed 0.5.0 release (historical)

Status recorded 2026-09-07: the recursive-purity milestone and 0.5.0 release
are complete on main. Kyle authorized continuing through the described
merge/build/verify/publish steps. No release work or confirmed review finding
remains pending; future work requires a new request.

PR https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/pull/3 merged as
`d770b8335a06a8ec6e5925030c4a92cde88e85d8`. Its tree equals reviewed head
`39fa142800c7bfc33e407fb93718960f91fe90d9`. All ten PR CI jobs and all ten
post-merge jobs passed. The local and merged CI source gates each passed
41 suites, 14,210 assertions, 32-module expanded purity, and complete
boundaries/source inventory. The automated review's one suggestion did not
match observed module-wide binding behavior; source and packaged-runtime
probes disproved it, the PR records the assessment, and its thread is resolved.

Published release: https://github.com/kserrec/attalambda/releases/tag/v0.5.0,
at `2026-09-07T20:21:07Z`. Unsigned annotated tag `v0.5.0` points to the exact
clean merged commit used for the Racket CS 9.3 Linux archive. The final archive
passed the isolated Ubuntu consumer, including 31 public-API checks with
`rec` execution and partial application, guide, file/TCP/HTTP, process statuses,
and relocation. Fresh public downloads matched both verified local hashes.
Archive SHA-256:
`9d87027d3fcad80c58668ce2d1d31365bba507131bc67889118e3d2ae7af36c4`.
Linux x86-64 remains the sole supported binary download; older releases remain
preserved. macOS and Windows provide internal portability evidence only.

[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) records the completed work and local evidence paths.
[docs/releases/0.5.0.md](docs/releases/0.5.0.md) explains `rec` and migration
from recursive `def`; [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) describes the released API.
The [release ledger](docs/design/standalone-distribution.md) records exact
commits, tag/asset IDs, sizes, hashes, and consumer results. The publication
record changes documentation only, outside the tagged build inputs.

## Completed 0.4.0 release (historical)

Status recorded 2026-09-06: the public API/List update, PR review, merge, and
0.4.0 release are complete. Kyle explicitly authorized each of those actions.
The checkout is on main. Subsequent release/feature work requires a new request;
the completed plans are historical evidence, not instructions to repeat work.
